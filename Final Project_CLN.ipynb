    "Salt Lake City is a growing metropolitan area. With a booming tech industry and major companies like Adobe, Microsoft, Facebook, and Vivint Solar building sites in northern Utah, population is increasing at a rapid rate in the Beehive State. With this growth comes many business opportunities for food services, such as dessert venues, in the major population center of Salt Lake City. Opening a restaurant of any sort is risky business, since many do not survive the first six months. Knowing prime locations to open venues is helpful in making an informed decision that may contribute to success Specifically, we will be examining areas of Salt Lake City to determine areas where someone interested in opening an ice cream parlor will most likely find success."

    "There are a few factors we can look at in determining what neighborhoods are good places to establish an ice cream venue. The number and type of restaurants in an area will give a clue as to which neighborhoods are already known for their food services. Moving to a neighborhood that already has several ice cream parlors means that the area's market will likely be saturated and unable to sustain another. The number of complementary businesses like stadiums, theatres, business districts, malls, and transportation hubs in a neighborhood also tends to have a positive correlation with the number of people who are likely to visit a dessert venue, since it is popular to get dessert after visiting these types of places. Restaurants that serve meals need to be considered separately, since they can be considered both competitors (since they often serve desserts as well as main courses) and complementary businesses (since people may visit an ice cream parlor for dessert after a meal). Population is another statistic that can be taken into account. While a larger population means that the ice cream parlor would be closer to homes (and thus easier to visit), it means that it will often be located further from complementary businesses and working areas. A population of zero in an area means that there are more businesses and less residential areas nearby. Both sides will be taken into account in comparing and pointing out which zip codes are likely good areas for an ice cream parlor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Foursquare analysis can be used to examine which neighborhoods have ice cream parlors, restaurants and complementary businesses. http://www.heartandcoeur.com/heart_travel/area/utah_801.php has a table of zip codes for the Salt Lake City, Utah area with neighborhoods listed. https://www.zip-codes.com/city/ut-salt-lake-city.asp has information about the population of these zip codes. In the case that attempts to pull latitude and longitude from geocoder does not work, http://saltlakecity.areaconnect.com/zip2.htm?city=Salt has that information that can be used to compile a .csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A table will be compiled that identifies the number of various businesses in each zip code. Businesses will be grouped by complementary businesses (like those listed above), restaurants, competitors (various dessert venues) as well as populations for each zip code in a table that will be used for clustering zip codes and to analyze for indications which cluster of zip codes has characteristics that are desirable for starting an ice cream parlor (a higher number of complementary businesses and a lower number of competitors).
